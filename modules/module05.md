# Module 05 - Classifications

[< Previous Module](../modules/module04.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Module>](../modules/module06.md)

## :thinking: Prerequisites

* An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) with an active subscription.
* An Azure Azure Purview account (see [module 01](../modules/module01.md)).
* An Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Account (see [module 02](../modules/module02.md)).

## :hammer: Tools

* [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/)

## :loudspeaker: Introduction

Azure Purview provides a large set of default classifications that represent typical data types that might exist in your data estate (e.g. email address, credit card number, passport number, etc). You also have the ability to create custom classifications if any of the default classifications don't meet your needs.

## :dart: Objectives

* Create a custom classification.
* Trigger a scan that will apply the custom classification to an asset.

    ![New Classification](../images/module05/05.01-classifications-new.png)

2. Populate the classification fields as per the example below and click **OK**.

    | Field  | Example Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | `Twitter_Handle` |
    | Description | `The username that appears at the end of your unique Twitter URL.` |

    ![Create Classification](../images/module05/05.02-classifications-create.png)

3. Navigate to the **Custom** tab to confirm the custom classification has been created.

    ![Create Classification](../images/module05/05.03-classifications-custom.png)

<div align="right"><a href="#module-05---classifications">↥ back to top</a></div>

## 2. Create a Custom Classification Rule (Regular Expression)

1. Navigate to **Management Center** > **Classification rules** (under Metadata management) and click **New**.

    ![New Classification Rule](../images/module05/05.04-classificationrules-new.png)

2. Populate the classification rule fields as per the example below and click **Continue**.

    | Field  | Example Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | `Twitter_Handle` |
    | Description | `The username that appears at the end of your unique Twitter URL.` |
    | Classification name | `Twitter Handle` |
    | State | `Enabled` |
    | Type | `Regular Expression` |

    > :bulb: **Did you know?**
    >
    > There are two types of classification rules. **Regular Expression** performs pattern matching against the actual data and/or column name. Where as **Dictionary** based classification rules allows us to supply a list of all possible values via a CSV or TSV file.

    ![Regular Expression Classification Rule](../images/module05/05.05-classificationrules-regex.png)

3. Download a copy of **[twitter_handles.csv](https://github.com/tayganr/purviewlab/raw/main/assets/twitter_handles.csv)** to your local machine.

4. Click the **Browse** icon and open the local copy of **[twitter_handles.csv](https://github.com/tayganr/purviewlab/raw/main/assets/twitter_handles.csv)**.

5. Select the data pattern associated to the **Handle** column and click **Add to patterns**.

    > :bulb: **Did you know?**
    >
    > **Thresholds** help minimise the possibility of false-positive classifications. **Distinct data values threshold** is the total number of distinct data values that need to be found in a column before the scanner will run the data pattern on it. **Minimum match threshold** is the minimum percentage of data value matches in a column that needs to be found by the scanner for the classification to be applied.

    ![Pattern Detection](../images/module05/05.06-regex-file.png)

6. Modify the Data Pattern by replacing the plus symbol (`+`) with with `{5,15}`.

    * The plus symbol (`+`) indicates one or more characters matching the preceding item. This may lead to false positives as it would allow for an unlimited number of alphanumeric characters. Twitter handles must be a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 15 characters.
    * With `{5,15}`, this will ensure matches only occur where there is a at least 5 and at most 15 occurrences of the preceding item.

7. While we can also specify a **Column Pattern**, in this example we will rely solely on the Data Pattern. Clear the **Column Pattern** input and click **Create**.

## 3. Create a Scan Rule Set

1. Navigate to **Management Center** > **Scan rule sets** (under General) and click **New**.

    > :bulb: **Did you know?**
    >
    > **Scan Rule Sets** determine which **File Types** and **Classification Rules** are in scope. If you want to include a custom file type or custom classification rule as part of a scan, a custom scan rule set will need to be created.

    ![New Scan Rule Set](../images/module05/05.08-scanruleset-new.png)

2. Populate the scan rule set fields as per the example below and click **Continue**.

    | Field  | Example Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Source Type | `Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2` |
    | Scan rule set name | `twitter_scan_rule_set` |
    | Scan rule description | `Custom scan rule set to detect parquet files and classify twitter handles.` |

    ![Scan Rule Set Name](../images/module05/05.09-scanruleset-create.png)

3. Clear all file type selections with the exception of **PARQUET** and click **Continue**.

    ![Scan Rule Set File Type](../images/module05/05.10-scanruleset-filetype.png)

4. Clear all selected System rules and select the custom classification rule **Twitter_Handle** and click **Create**.

    ![Test Connection](../images/module05/05.18-scan-test.png)

3. By default, Azure Purview will have the parent Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account selected and therefore include all paths in scope. To reduce the scope, deselect the parent and select the **Twitter** folder only.

    ![Scope Scan](../images/module05/05.19-scan-scope.png)

4. To validate the scope of the custom scan rule set, click **View detail**.

    ![Scan Rule Set Details](../images/module05/05.20-scanruleset-viewdetail.png)

5. Confirm that the custom scan rule set includes the **PARQUET** file type and the custom classification rule **Twitter_Handle**. Click **OK**.

    ![Verify Scan Rule Set](../images/module05/05.21-scanruleset-verify.png)

6. Select the custom scan rule set **twitter_scan_rule_set** and click **Continue**.

    ![Select Scan Rule Set](../images/module05/05.22-scanruleset-select.png)

7. Set the scan trigger to **Once** and click **Continue**.

    ![Scan Cadence](../images/module05/05.23-scan-trigger.png)

8. Click **Save and Run**.

    ![Run Scan](../images/module05/05.24-scan-saverun.png)

9. To view the progress of the scan, navigate to **Sources** and click **View details** on the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account.

    ![Source Details](../images/module05/05.25-source-viewdetails.png)

10. Periodically click **Refresh** to update the scan status until **Complete**. Note: This will take approximately 5 minutes.

    ![Scan Progress](../images/module05/05.26-source-progress.png)

<div align="right"><a href="#module-05---classifications">↥ back to top</a></div>

## 6. Search by Classification

1. Once the scan has complete, perform a wildcard search by typing in the asterisk character (**\***) into the search bar and hit Enter.

    ![Wildcard Search](../images/module05/05.27-search-wildcard.png)

2. Limit the search results by setting **Classification** within the filter panel to **Twitter Handle**. Click on the asset title (**twitter_handles.parquet**) to view the asset details.

    ![Filter Classification](../images/module05/05.28-search-filter.png)

3. You will notice on the Overview tab that the schema includes the Twitter Handle classification. To identity which column has been classified, navigate to the **Schema** tab.

    ![Asset Details](../images/module05/05.29-asset-details.png)

4. Within the Schema tab we can see that **Account name** is the column that has been classified.
