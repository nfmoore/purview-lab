# Module 03 - Search & Browse

[< Previous Module](../modules/module02.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Module>](../modules/module04.md)

## :thinking: Prerequisites

* An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) with an active subscription.
* An Azure Azure Purview account (see [module 01](../modules/module01.md)).
* An Azure Purview catalog with some assets (see [module 02](../modules/module02.md)).

## :loudspeaker: Introduction

Once sources have been registered and scanned, the underlying data catalog will begin to populate with assets that represent real-world objects (e.g. a table in an Azure SQL Database, a Power BI report, etc.) The surfacing of these assets via Azure Purview's search experience helps empower data consumers to find data assets that matters to them.

## :dart: Objectives

* Search the catalog by keyword.
* Browse the catalog by source.
* Update an existing asset.
* Perform a bulk edit operation.

## Table of Contents

1. [Search Catalog](#1-search-catalog)

3. [Update an Asset](#2-update-an-asset)

2. Filter the search results by **Classification** (e.g. Country/Region) and click the hyperlinked asset name to view the details (e.g. QueriesByState).

## 2. Update an Asset

1. Click **Edit** to modify the asset details.

    ![Edit Asset](../images/module03/03.03-asset-edit.png)

2. Update the **Description** by copying and pasting the sample text below.

    > This dataset was curated from the Bing search logs (desktop users only) over the period of Jan 1st, 2020 – (Current Month - 1). Only searches that were issued many times by multiple users were included. The dataset includes queries from all over the world that had an intent related to the Coronavirus or Covid-19. In some cases this intent is explicit in the query itself (e.g., “Coronavirus updates Seattle”), in other cases it is implicit , e.g. “Shelter in place”.

3. Assign a **Classification** (e.g. World Cities) using the drop-down menu.

    | IsImplicitIntent | `True if query did not mention covid or coronavirus or sarsncov2 (e.g, “Shelter in place”). False otherwise.`                                                                                           |

    | PopularityScore  | `Value between 1 and 100 inclusive. 1 indicates least popular query on the day/State/Country with Coronavirus intent, and 100 indicates the most popular query for the same geography on the same day.` |

    > :bulb: **Did you know?**
    >
    > **Classifications** and **Glossary Terms** can be assigned at the asset level (e.g. a Table within a Database) as well as at the schema level (e.g. a Column within a Table Schema).

    ![Update Schema](../images/module03/03.06-asset-schema.png)

5. Navigate to the **Contacts** tab and set someone within your organization to be an **Expert** and an **Owner**. Click **Save**.

    > :bulb: **Did you know?**
    >
    > Assets can be related to two different types of contacts. **Experts** are often business process or subject matter experts. Where as **Owners** are often senior executives or business area owners that define governance or business processes over certain data areas.

    ![Update Contacts](../images/module03/03.07-asset-contacts.png)

6. To see other assets within the same path, navigate to the **Related** tab.

## 3. Browse Assets

While the search experience is ideal for keyword based discovery, Purview Studio also allows users to navigate the catalog by source.

1. Open Purview Studio and from the **Home** screen, click **Browse assets**.

    ![Browse Assets](../images/module03/03.09-home-browse.png)

2. Select a **source** (e.g. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2).

    ![ADLS Gen2](../images/module03/03.10-browse-adls.png)

3. Select an **account** (e.g. storage2486).

    ![ADLS Gen2 Account](../images/module03/03.11-browse-account.png)

4. Select a **container** (e.g. raw).

    ![ADLS Gen2 Container](../images/module03/03.12-browse-container.png)

> Note: Azure Purview allows us to perform certain operations (add/replace/remove) against a subset of attributes (Expert, Owner, Term, Classification) in bulk directly within Purview Studio.
