* Your must have permissions to create resources in your Azure subscription.
* Your subscription must have the following resource providers registered: **Microsoft.Purview**, **Microsoft.Storage**, and **Microsoft.EventHub**.

## :loudspeaker: Introduction

To create and use the Azure Purview platform, you will need to provision an Azure Purview account.

## :dart: Objectives

* Create an Azure Purview account using the Azure portal.
* Provide users the necessary level of access to Azure Purview's data plane.

## 1. Create an Azure Purview Account

1. A Purview account has already been created for you. This account has been created with the following **Configuration**:

    | Parameter     | Example Value      | Note                                     |
    | ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
    | Platform size | `4 capacity units` | Sufficient for non-production scenarios. |

    > :bulb: **Did you know?**
    >
    > **Capacity Units** determine the size of the platform and is a **provisioned** (fixed) set of resources that is needed to keep the Azure Purview platform up and running. 1 Capacity Unit is able to support approximately 1 API call per second. Capacity Units are required regardless of whether you plan to invoke the Azure Purview API endpoints directly (i.e. ISV scenario) or indirectly via Purview Studio (GUI).
    > 
    > **vCore Hours** on the other hand is the unit used to measure **serverless** compute that is needed to run a scan. You only pay per vCore Hour of scanning that you consume (rounded up to the nearest minute).
    >

    | Role                              | Catalog      | Sources/Scans | Description                                                      |
    | --------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Purview Data Reader               | `Read`       |               | Access to Purview Studio (read only).                            |
    | Purview Data Curator              | `Read/Write` |               | Access to Purview Studio (read & write).                         |
    | Purview Data Source Administrator |              | `Read/Write`  | No access to Purview Studio. Manage data sources and data scans. |
