# Module 07 - Insights

[< Previous Module](../modules/module06.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Module>](../modules/module08.md)

## :thinking: Prerequisites

* An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) with an active subscription.
* An Azure Azure Purview account (see [module 01](../modules/module01.md)).
* Set up and complete a scan (see [module 02](../modules/module02.md)).

> Note: Insights can take several hours post the completion of a scan to reflect new assets.

## :loudspeaker: Introduction

Insights provides customers, a single pane of glass view into their catalog and further aims to provide specific insights to the data source administrators, business users, data stewards, data officer, and security administrators. Azure Purview currently has the following reports available:

* Assets
* Scans
* Glossary
* Classification
* Sensitivity Labels
* File Extensions

> **Note: This module is for illustrative purposes only. Participants will not have sufficient variety in their lab environment to produce the insights displayed here. Please read through the content here**

## :dart: Objectives

* Understand the different types of insights that can be gleaned from the out of the box reporting.

## 1. Asset Insights

1. Open Purview Studio, navigate to **Insights** > **Assets**.

    ![Assets KPI](../images/module07/07.02-assets-kpi.png)

3. Further down the page you will find additional **data visualizations**, typically these tiles will allow interactive filtering and the ability to drill-down into the underlying detail by clicking **View more**. The Assets page includes the following **graphs**:

    **Asset Count per Source Type**

    > :bulb: **Did you know?**
    >
    > Using the quick filters on the **Asset Count per Source Type** graph and drilling into the details by clicking **View more**, is a quick and easy way of identifying which sources contain certain types of data.

## 5. Sensitivity Labels Insights

1. Open Purview Studio, navigate to **Insights** > **Sensitivity Labels**.

    > :bulb: **Did you know?**
    >
    > **Sensitivity labels** state how sensitive data is in your organization. For example, data contained within a particular asset might be `highly confidential`. **Classifications** on the other hand indicate the type of data values (e.g. Driver's License Number, Email Address, SWIFT Code, etc) 
    >
    > Azure Purview's ability to apply sensitivity labels is due to the close integration with **Microsoft Information Protection** offered in Microsoft 365. Note: You must turn on Information Protection for Azure Purview in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. For more information, check out how to [Automatically label your data in Azure Purview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/purview/create-sensitivity-label).
